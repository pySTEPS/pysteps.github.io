The pySTEPS initiative  is a community that develops and maintains an easy to use, modular, free and open-source **python framework for short-term ensemble prediction systems**.

The focus is on **probabilistic nowcasting of radar precipitation fields**, but pySTEPS is designed to allow a wider range of uses.

You can find the pysteps package on github.com: [https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps](https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps). Also checkout this [overview poster](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332781022_pysteps_-_a_Community-Driven_Open-Source_Library_for_Precipitation_Nowcasting).

## Documentation

The pysteps documentation is available on Read the Docs

[https://pysteps.readthedocs.io](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io)

This also includes a [gallery of tutorials](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html) and the [reference guide](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pysteps_reference/index.html) for all modules and functions available in pysteps.

## Quick-start guide

The easiest way to install pysteps is through [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pysteps). To install the pysteps package in an existing conda environment:

`conda install -c conda-forge pysteps`

Please refer to the pysteps [installation guide](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/install_pysteps.html) for more detailed installation instructions.

## Get in touch

We encourage you to open [Issues](https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps/issues) via our [GitHub page](https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps). Alternatively, get in touch with the pysteps community on our [pysteps slack](https://pysteps.slack.com/). To get access to it, you first need to subscripbe using the following automatic [invitation page](https://pysteps-slackin.herokuapp.com/). This page can sometimes take a while to load so please be patient.

## ERAD2020 short-course

A second edition of our nowcasting workshop will take place at [ERAD2020](https://www.erad2020.ch/) in Locarno, Switzerland, on Aug 30th! Registration are already open, book your place and find more info [here](https://www.erad2020.ch/short-courses-1).

**Important update:** The 11th ERAD is postponed to 2022, see the official communication from the organizers [here](https://www.erad2020.ch/). The pysteps short course is consequently cancelled.

## ERAD2018 short-course

Our first workshop using *pysteps* took place during ERAD2018 in Ede-Wageningen, NL, on 1 July 2018. With over 30 participants, this was a very successful workshop! We would like to thank all the participants for their enthusiasm and commitment!

The short-course description and training material are available on the [ERAD2018 website](https://www.erad2018.nl/short-courses/) (search for short-course 4: *Radar-based Ensemble Precipitation Nowcasting*).
