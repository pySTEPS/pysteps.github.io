The pySTEPS initiative  is a community that develops and maintains an easy to use, modular, free and open source python framework for short-term ensemble prediction systems.

The focus is on **probabilistic nowcasting of radar precipitation fields**, but pySTEPS is designed to allow a wider range of uses.

## Documentation

The pysteps documentation is available on Read the Docs

[https://pysteps.readthedocs.io](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io)

This also includes a [gallery of tutorials](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html) and the [reference guide](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pysteps_reference/index.html) for all modules and functions available in pysteps.

Note that the [old documentation](https://pysteps.github.io/pysteps/refmanual/) for V0.2 is currently still available.

## Download pysteps

The most recent release of pysteps is available [here](https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps/releases).

## ERAD2018 short-course

Our first workshop using *pysteps* took place during ERAD2018 in Ede-Wageningen, NL, on 1 July 2018. With over 30 participants, this was a very successful workshop! We would like to thank all the participants for their enthusiasm and commitment! 

The short-course description and training material are available on the [ERAD2018 website](https://www.erad2018.nl/short-courses/) (search for short-course 4: *Radar-based Ensemble Precipitation Nowcasting*).

## Quick-start guide
It is very easy to start using *pysteps*! You simply need to install the dependencies, download the latest *pysteps* version and install it.

Please refer to the [README document](https://github.com/pySTEPS/pysteps/blob/master/README.rst) in our main github repository for the installation instructions.
